# LLM-Mihiran from Scratch

Hey there! This is my project to create a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using Python. I'm following the tutorial from freeCodeCamp's YouTube video "Create a Large Language Model from Scratch with Python".

## What's This All About?

I'm building a basic LLM to understand how these things work under the hood. It's a learning project, so expect some rough edges and ongoing changes!

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- Python 3.x
- Some Python libraries (I'll update this list as I go along)

### Setting Up

1. Clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-from-scratch.git
   ```
2. Go to the project folder:
   ```
   cd llm-from-scratch
   ```
3. Install the stuff you need (I'll update this later):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use It

I'm still working on this part. Once I've got something running, I'll add instructions here on how to play with the LLM.

## What's in Here?

As I build out the project, I'll update this section to give you a quick tour of the code.

## Thanks To

- The folks at freeCodeCamp for their tutorial
- [I might add more shoutouts later]

Feel free to fork this or use it for your own learning.
